Hello world!
Yifei Sun
To be honest, I consider myself as a pretty pessimistic person.
I felt very nervous when I knew that I must use new coding platform which I have never heard of.
But I believe with professor's help and my endeavor, I can conquer it.
Hope this homework can be a good starting point~.
